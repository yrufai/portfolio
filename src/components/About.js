        <h3>Hello!</h3>
        <p>
          My name is El-rufai and I am a front end developer. I love building
          beautiful and interactive things on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I started coding I worked as a basic school teacher for several
          years but I always wanted to do something a little more creative, so I
          started coding and loved it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was born and raised in Ghana, love being creative and taking up new
          challenges. That's how I ended up being a web developer and is pretty
          a challenging field to be in. #bornToCode
